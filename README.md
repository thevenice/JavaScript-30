<h2>Day 1 : Drum sounds with keyboard</h2>
     <h3>explanation of program:</h3>
      <em> What this program is doing?<em>
      <p>
     -this script connects one of my key and an audio file with a attribute data-key.<br/>
     -this thing happens within html but the transition that we have sync with over keys is inside css.<br/>
     -we made a class in css 'playing' that contains styling, that applies only if transition happen.<br/>
     -so we added class 'playing' in script, that adds styling while we use the key.<br/>
     -but we have to remove that styling after specific time.<br/>
     -so we added foreach into keys and removed that class at that specific time.<br/>
     -so this makes our display program like a buzzer as soon as i press it become red for specific time.<br/>
