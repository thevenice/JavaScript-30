# JavaScript-30 logs:
Day 1 : Drum sounds with keyboard
explanation of program:
 What this program is doing?
     -this script connects one of my key and an audio file with a attribute data-key
     -this thing happens within html but the transition that we have sync with over keys is inside css
     -we made a class in css 'playing' that contains styling, that applies only if transition happen
     -so we added class 'playing' in script, that adds styling while we use the key
     -but we have to remove that styling after specific time
     -so we added foreach into keys and removed that class at that specific time
     -so this makes our display program like a buzzer as soon as i press it become red for specific time
